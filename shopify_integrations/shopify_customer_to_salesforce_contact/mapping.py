"""How a Shopify customer maps onto a Salesforce Contact.

**This is the file to edit when the field mapping changes.** Add an entry to
``contact_mapping()``, and a length to ``MAX_FIELD_LENGTH`` if the target field
has one; add the matching field to the query in ``source.py`` if Shopify is not
already returning it.

It is deliberately pure: no environment reads, no I/O, and nothing imported from
``main`` or ``source``. That keeps it unit-testable on a dict fixture and means
it could be lifted into a shared package unchanged.

Each mapping value is a source path, a ``(path, transform)`` pair, or a callable.
Only the fields that need real logic are functions; the rest are paths. The
mechanics -- stripping, dropping empties, truncating, joining, matching picklists
-- live in ``otter_connectors``.
