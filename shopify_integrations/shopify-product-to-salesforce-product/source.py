"""What this integration reads from Shopify.

The queries live in ``queries/*.graphql`` as documents rather than as strings
assembled here. That is the whole point: a ``.graphql`` file is a first-class
artifact the editor understands, so you get completion against the real Shopify
schema, inline errors for a field that does not exist, and a jump-to-definition
into ``schema/shopify/shopify.graphql`` -- none of which a Python string gets you.
``graphql.config.yml`` at the repo root wires the two together. The file is also
what ``tests/test_source.py`` validates, so a query that does not match the
pulled schema fails a test rather than a 6am run.

**Products, not variants.** ``productVariants`` is the flatter connection and was
the obvious root, but a product-level change does not bump its variants'
``updatedAt``: in this store 14 of 17 products are newer than every one of their
variants. A variant-level watermark therefore misses a renamed product forever,
and the mapping reads ``product.title``. So the root is ``products`` and the
watermark is compared against ``Product.updatedAt``.

The cost is a nested connection. ``variants`` inside a product is capped by
Shopify, so ``pageInfo`` is selected and ``all_variants`` fetches the remainder
through ``product-variants.graphql``. Silently syncing the first page of a
large product is the failure mode that arrangement exists to prevent.

**The mapping is written against a variant, though.** ``variants_with_product``
is what reconciles the two: it hands each variant its parent under ``product``,
so ``ProductVariant.product.id`` names the product the variant was fetched
beneath, and ``mapping.py`` stays the only place a field is named.
