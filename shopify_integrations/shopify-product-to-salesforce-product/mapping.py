"""How a Shopify product variant maps onto a Salesforce Product2.

**This is the file to edit when the field mapping changes.** Add an entry to
``variant_mapping()``; add the matching field to ``queries/products.graphql`` if
Shopify is not already returning it. Target lengths come from the schema
references themselves, so there is no truncation table to keep in step.

It is deliberately pure: no environment reads, no I/O, and nothing imported from
``main`` or ``source``. That keeps it unit-testable on a dict fixture and means
it could be lifted into a shared package unchanged.

Each mapping value is a source path, a ``(path, transform)`` pair, or a callable.
Only the fields that need real logic are functions; the rest are paths. The
mechanics -- stripping, dropping empties, truncating, joining, matching picklists
-- live in ``otter_connectors``.

# Salesforce truncates silently rather than complaining, so build_record does it

# It reads the length off the mapping *key*, so it still applies to a field whose
# value is a callable.
